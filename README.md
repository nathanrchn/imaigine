Hello, today I am introducing Imaigine, a platform for creating and sharing personalized AI models.

To create personalized images, you have to take a picture and then manually edit it. But this is a thing of the past!

Now we can use AI models to generate images based on your own photos. So that's what Imaigine is for!

I have a couple of photos of my face and I want to create an AI model based on them.

Ok back to the presentation! Now that our model is training, how could we sell it? Imagine is the first platform for fine-tuned AI models. It allow creators to sell their models to other users using the blockchain technology. It allows creators to receive royalties every time their model is used! All of this is made possible by the use of the SUI blockchain.

What is Imaigine? It's a platform for creating and sharing personalized AI models. Users can fine tune models on their own photos and share them with others. When we use a model, we can directly mint NFTs with it! It allows creators to receive royalties every time their model is used!

How does it work? Imaigine is built on top of Kiosk. Kiosk provides a framework to buy and sell models. It allows creators to receive royalties every time their model is used! We also added Stashed Wallet to allow users to connect using zkLogin for easy onboarding!

That's all! Thank you for your attention!
